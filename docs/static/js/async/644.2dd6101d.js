It should clearly state the proposal's purpose and rationale.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for the LEA blockchain. Include any modifications to existing structures (like CTE tags/fields), new data structures, algorithms, or protocols.\n\n## Rationale\n\nExplain the reasoning behind the design decisions in the specification. Why were particular design choices made? What alternatives were considered, and why were they not chosen? This section should cover engineering trade-offs.\n\n## Backwards Compatibility\n\nDiscuss any backwards compatibility implications. Does this change break existing rules or implementations? How will the transition be handled? Proposals that are not backward compatible must specify how the incompatibility is justified.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nDescribe any security implications or considerations related to this LIP. This includes potential attack vectors, impacts on privacy, or changes to the system's overall security assumptions.\n\n## Copyright\n\nAll LIPs must be licensed under an appropriate open-source license (e.g., MIT License).\n"})}),"\n",(0,n.jsxs)(i.h2,{id:"rationale",children:["Rationale",(0,n.jsx)(i.a,{className:"header-anchor","aria-hidden":"true",href:"#rationale",children:"#"})]}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(i.p,{children:"Adopting a standardized structure based on common practices in other blockchain projects (like BIPs/EIPs) provides immediate clarity and familiarity.
